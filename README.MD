# Cluckr

A twitter clone for a semester project in an advanced php class. Plenty of issues here that I would definitely rework, but at the time this was something I was very proud to have created. 

## File Structure
* css - Custom CSS and Bootstrap
* fonts - Icons
* img - Various Images like default profile pictures and the site favicon.
* js - Various Scripts for the front end
* scripts - Various Scripts for the back end and dealing with the database. init.php creates the database tables.
* snippets - Bits of code to build pages with
* user - I wanted to have urls follow this structure: site.com/user/uname. Not knowing how to write an API to handle this, I opted instead to have actual files created during the registration process. This unholy folder is the result.

## Built With

* [PHP](http://www.php.net/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
